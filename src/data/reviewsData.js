She did a personal show for my daughter's birthday a few years ago, and just recently, we attended her New Year Bubble show. It was a memorable event. My son, who is 12, thoroughly enjoyed. Even my husband, who usually looks at his phone, watched the entire show, captivated by Maria's magic. "Wow Bear" is a must-have addition to every event!`,

I've had a lot of various parties for my kids over the years but Maria's party by far is the best. She truly loves what she does and it shows. She engaged the kids and parents the whole time. She has some cool tricks up her sleeve and the bubbles you'll see range from tinies to gigantic. It's truly not something I've ever seen before.",
